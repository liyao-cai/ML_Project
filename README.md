The purpose of this project is to design a machine learning model to predict the building environment. The dataset used this time is from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/274/sml2010. 
The purpose of this project is to design a machine learning model for predicting the building environment. The dataset used this time is from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/274/sml2010.
This project uses three machine learning models, namely LSTM, Transformer, and TCN.
The results are measured by R2, MSE, and MAE.
